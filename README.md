overview
This repository contains a Python script for image classification using the Bag of Words model. The code uses the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm for feature extraction and employs the k-means clustering algorithm to create visual word descriptors. The classification is performed using Support Vector Machines (SVM).
